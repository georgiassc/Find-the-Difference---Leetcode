# Find the Difference - Leetcode

## Problem Statement

You are given two strings, `s` and `t`.

String `t` is generated by randomly shuffling string `s` and then adding one more letter at a random position.

**Goal:**  
Return the letter that was added to `t`.

### Example:

```text
Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"  
Output: "e"
```

## Solution Overview

This C solution calculates the sum of ASCII values of the characters in both strings s and t.
Since t contains all characters from s plus one additional character, the difference between the two sums corresponds to the extra character added in t.

## Code

```c
char findTheDifference(char * s, char * t) {
    int sumS = 0;
    int sumT = 0;
    int i = 0;

    while (t[i] != '\0') {
        sumT += (int)t[i];
        if (s[i] != '\0')
            sumS += (int)s[i];
        i++;
    }

    return (char)(sumT - sumS);
}
```
